          <div class="accordion-content-inner">
            <p>Glassmorphism is a UI design trend that emphasizes light, depth, and a "through the glass" effect. It's characterized by a frosted-glass look, often achieved with background blurs, transparency, and subtle borders to create a sense of hierarchy and dimension.</p>
